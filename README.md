golemGraphWavePair
==================

Use the Golem Network to generate graph frames, then combine them into an animation.

The animation shows how the wave changes as the inputs vary. It also shades the area between the two waves (green when they are close together, fading to red as they move further apart).

Generate images using the Golem Network (relies on setup from the [tutorial](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/create-your-own-application-on-golem/the-steps-to-do)):

    ./golemGraph.py

Generate images locally (for testing):

    ./localGraph.py
